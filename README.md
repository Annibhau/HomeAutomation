Creating a home automation system using the ESP8266 microcontroller is a fascinating project that can be detailed in a GitHub README. Here is a basic template you can use:

Home Automation using ESP8266
This project aims to create a home automation system using the ESP8266 microcontroller. With this system, you can control various electronic devices at your home remotely using a Wi-Fi connection.

Requirements
ESP8266 Microcontroller
Arduino IDE
Relay Modules
Jumper Wires
Electronic Components (as required by your specific project)
Wi-Fi Router
Setup
Install Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website: Arduino IDE

Add ESP8266 Support: Open the Arduino IDE, navigate to File > Preferences and paste the following URL into the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field:

bash
Copy code
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
Then, navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for "esp8266" and install the package.

Clone this Repository: Clone this repository using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Setup the Circuit: Connect the ESP8266 to the relay modules and other components based on your specific circuit design.

Configure Wi-Fi Credentials: Modify the config.h file with your Wi-Fi credentials.

Upload the Code: Open the Arduino IDE, open the project folder, and upload the code to the ESP8266 microcontroller.

Usage
To use the home automation system:

Power on the ESP8266 and ensure it's connected to the Wi-Fi network.
Access the IP address of the ESP8266 through a web browser or a mobile app.
Use the interface to control the connected devices.
